=== UNDERSTANDING GITORIOUS ===

One of the main challenges in Gitorious is its installation process.
It is anything but trivial.

The main piece is a plain vanilla Ruby on Rails web application, and
this is the easiest part.

The purpose of the web front-end is to concentrate all Git projects in
an easy to manage user interface, which also makes it easy to make
clones, send merge requests, manage committers and participate through
comments in the website itself. The user interface also provides a
nice visualization of the commit log and the source tree. So this is a
high quality website for Git project management.

Gitorious can be used for any number of Git workflows. It is easier to
create a Centralized Workflow model, where you have one central Git
repository and many committers added to it, as well as the Integration
Workflow, where you have a "mainline" repository. Other developers can
clone from it, keep pushing commits in their own cloned repositories
and once they're done with some feature, they can easily send a merge
request back to the maintainer of the original mainline.

Take a look at Scott Chacon's explanation on these workflows:

== THE MAIN PIECES ==

For all of this to work, we need more than a front-end web application. There are
backend pieces that we will have to understand and deal with.

I'll make a general explanation of the architecture and then you will find
specific procedures at:

* doc/recipes/install-centos.txt
* doc/recipes/install-ubuntu.txt

First of all, we need Git installed on the machine. We also need a
MySQL database where the project metadata is stored.

All non-web operations goes through SSH, so we need that installed
too. More than that, Gitorious was kind of inspired by an older
project called Gitosis. It has a clever idea on which there is one
local user (usually called "git"). And every developer from any
project use this same user.

That's how you clone a remote repository from what's called your "Push URL":

  git clone git@gitorious.org/gitorious/mainline.git

It is very similar as operating over an SSH URL:

  git clone ssh://git@gitorious.org/~gitorious/mainline.git

And that's exactly what happens. Let's break it down:

* git           - is the 'special' user on the server
* gitorious.org - is the server itself, which needs to have
* ~             - (tilde) as all Unix users will know, it is the alias for the home
                  directory, in this case it means "/home/git"
* gitorious     - is the project directory under the home directory of the user git.
                  And the neat thing about this is that every clone of the mainline
                  repository goes under this umbrella directory.
* mainline.git  - is the git repository directory under the project.

It would be odd if everybody had permission to login under the same
username: anyone could mess around any project's directories. But the
advantage of using SSH is that it is flexible enough to provide an
infrastructure to disallow such a thing.

As a technical detail, whenever you log in either using a normal ssh
client or the git command line, it will read its local
.ssh/authorized_keys file. Inside it you will find something similar
to this:

  ### START KEY 1 ###
  command="gitorious akitaonrails",no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,
  no-agent-forwarding,no-pty ssh-rsa AAAAB...MCay0w== fabioakita@MacHal9001.local
  ### END KEY 1 ###

I cut off the big ssh key for brevity. So whenever you try to login
through ssh, you will have your public key transferred and compared to
those in this file. This allow for the SSH server to find your entry
and therefore, which 'command' it should run. Then it will execute
'gitorious [your_login]' and it will check with the website's data if
you do or do not have access to the project you want to (it passes the
SSH arguments through to the gitorious command as well). That's how it
determines your identity and your permissions regardless of everybody
logging into the same local user account (ex. 'git').

You do all this through what's called a "Push URL", meaning that you
only use it if you have permission to push your changes back to the
repository (you're either the owner of the project or someone added
you as a committer).

If you don't have push permission, you will only see a "Public Clone
URL" that resembles this one:

  git clone git://gitorious.org/gitorious/gitorious.git

Instead of going through the SSH port, this one will connect to port
9418 of your server (if you have firewalls up, be sure to have this
port open).

If there is an open port, there is a daemons. The Gitorious project
also give your what's called the "git-daemon" which keeps running and
listening to this port. It allows for the git command to clone the
remote repository but not to push stuff back. This is good for
read-only scenarios.

== ASYNCHRONOUS OPERATIONS ==

Whenever you:

* Add a new ssh key to your account
* Create a new project
* Clone an existing project

Nothing will happen. Until you manually run the script/task_notifier
task inside your website's directory. This script will see what's
queued and run those tasks. It would be too time consuming to stay
inside a Controller's Action, so they were correctly detached into an
asynchronous process that will run when it can. Usually people set it
up as a Cron Job.

These kinds of actions triggers notifications to the users, so e-mails
are sent through plain vanilla sendmail as well.

So that covers the main pieces.

== OPTIONAL PIECES ==

The website provides a search functionality that depends on Sphinx and
the Ultrasphinx plugin for Rails. It is way smarter than a plain
"LIKE" operator from SQL, but it requires a living daemon and a task.

So you will need another daemon for Sphinx and you will also need
another Cron Job for Ultrasphinx's task that rebuilds the index to
reflect recent changes. Those are optional if you don't want or don't
need the search functionality.

There is another task called script/graph_generator which depends on
the Gruff and RMagick rubygems as well as the native ImageMagick
library. It generates a nice graph on commits frequency through the
days. When you run it, it will generate a PNG static image. If you
don't run it, Gitorious will simply ignore it. It is very cumbersome
to make this component work correctly.

== PRIVATE MODE ==

The original intent of Gitorious is for an open source public website
where every project is open to the public.

But as Gitorious itself is an open source project, people can choose
to have their own installation (as you will, as you're reading this
documentation).

Sometimes people want to install their own private Gitorious in a VPS
server. And then host their company's internal projects, for example.
But in this scenario, their private Gitorious would be publicly
exposed to the Internet.

Now you can change your config/gitorious.yml file and change this:

  public_mode: false

The default mode is 'true', which make your Gitorious public. But if
you want your own private server, change it to 'false'.

In private mode, the 'Register' page is also locked and you need to
create a super user manually. Do this in the server running the task
'script/create_admin'. It will ask for the administrator's email and
password and will create it for you.

== SUMMARY ==

So, the shopping list goes like this:

* install several operating system components, including Git and SSH
* set up a 'git' (or whatever other login name) local account
* install the Gitorious Rails-based website
* set up the git-daemon
* set up the sphinx daemon
* set up the task_notifier cron job
* set up the ultrasphinx cron job
* set up the graph_generator cron job
