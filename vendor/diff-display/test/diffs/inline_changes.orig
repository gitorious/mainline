Tom Copeland is the administrator for RubyForge, which opened in July 2003
and now hosts over 450 projects. Tom works at Rich Kilmer's red-minded
company InfoEther.

1. So, give us an idea. How much time do you put into RubyForge?

Hm. Maybe... half an hour a day of actual work. But I mull over it
constantly. And occasionally things arise that take more time, like
when we got the new hardware, and putting out the Wiki spam fires,
and so forth.

2. RubyForge has been an incredible contribution to Ruby coders. You are
so responsive and it's great to have an admin who is directly involved
with Ruby-Talk and all the various projects. What drives you to work on
RubyForge? TELL US!! WHY ARE YOU SO BLASTED GOOD??

Thank you! :blushes:

I don't know... it's fun to work on RubyForge, because I see lots of new
projects. For example, seeing Michael Neumann's postgres-pr project come
out was neat, because I was able to use it on RubyForge right away. Also,
I get to chat with lots of Rubyists about various things, and most of the
folks I talk with are much more savvy than I am, so I'm always learning
lots about Ruby and system administration and what-have-you. Especially
the what-have-you.

3. You've added so many excellent components: project wikis, RubyGems
integration, BitTorrents. Are there any components of RubyForge that
are bothersome? Anything you regret?

Let's not dwell on the sad things... we must leave them in our
wake. Instead, let us look ahead to a bright future, with Ruwiki replacing
UseMod as the default Wiki, with Subversion support, and with RubyForge
sitting on a 32 CPU Sun E10K behind a T3 pipe all purchased by my lottery
winnings! Note: some future items may be more likely than others.

4. Will you find a random image on Google to share with us?

Love those McGuffey Readers:

5. Getting anything cool for Christmas?

A 12 passenger van to contain carry my ever-growing family to and fro.
